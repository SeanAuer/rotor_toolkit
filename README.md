# rotor_toolkit

`rotor_toolkit` is a Python-based design and modeling library for rotorcraft and turbomachinery components, with a focus on modular, parametric geometry generation. The project began as a way to generate and manipulate 2D airfoils but is growing into a pipeline for defining and exporting full 3D rotor or stator assemblies for UAS, turbomachinery, hydrodynamic vehicles, and helicopters.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [`spline_toolkit`](https://github.com/SeanAuer/spline_toolkit) â€” required for spline-based geometry definitions

Make sure to install `spline_toolkit` before using the spline-based airfoil generation features.

## Components

### `Airfoil`
- Supports NACA 4-digit and 5-digit airfoil generation
- Accepts `.dat` or `.csv` airfoil files
- Allows fully custom coordinate input
- Parametric spline generation using control points (via `spline_toolkit`)
- Chord normalization, alignment to x-axis, and centerline enforcement
- Interactive plotting with support for matplotlib/plotly
- Dynamic evaluation of airfoil characteristics

### `Blade` (in work)
- Accepts a list of airfoil sections and spanwise definitions
- Will support twist, chord, and sweep distributions
- Generates 3D blade surface for lofting or export
- Will include sectional visualization and thickness plotting

### `Hub` (planned)
- Represents central hub geometry
- Allows placement of blades with defined angular spacing
- Simple geometric representation for early design/export

### `Rotor` (planned)
- Combines blades + hub + orientation
- Can define stators or rotors
- Will support clean geometry export (STL, surface grid, etc.)
- Planned integration with meshing/export utilities

## Current Capabilities

- Generate clean, smooth 2D airfoils using standard definitions or parametric control
- Plot airfoils interactively (`matplotlib` and `plotly`)
- Evaluate geometric metrics like chord length
- Export to CSV for post-processing
- Align airfoils along chord for consistency
- Manipulate control points on spline airfoils

## Example (Basic)

```python
from rotor_toolkit import Airfoil

# Generate a classic NACA 2412 4-digit airfoil
af = Airfoil(name="NACA2412", naca_code="2412", n_points=200)
af.plot()
```

## Philosophy

`rotor_toolkit` aims to enable parametric rotor and airfoil modeling in a streamlined, Python-based environment.

Goals:
- Script-based geometry creation and evaluation
- Quick iteration for design exploration
- Future integration with meshing, optimization, and export pipelines
